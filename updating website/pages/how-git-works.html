                        If we want to store our valuables, we go to the bank, if
                        we want to store code, we use Git. There are many places
                        to store code like GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab. Today,
                        I will show you some things you can do in GitHub.

                        Instead of keeping everything messed up, you can
                        organize it. Thatâ€™s why we use repositories. To create a
                        new repository press New. Then type the name of your
                        repository. The name should not have any spaces, the
                        name should be all lowercase and the name should be
                        hyphen separated. You can add a description but it is
                        optional. You can choose if it should be public or
                        private. Public means that everyone could see it and
                        private means that only you can see it. Then you can add
                        a README page. A README is a page that explains what
                        your project is about.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        If you want to change it from public to private then you
                        can go to Settings &gt; Options, then scroll down to
                        Danger Zone and click Change Visibility.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        If you want to give your repository to someone else,
                        then go to Danger Zone and press Transfer.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        If you want to change your repository access, then go to
                        Danger Zone and press Archive.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        If you want to delete your repository, then go to Danger
                        Zone and press Delete Repository.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        After you create the repository, go to Code &gt; Copy
                        (which is the green button that looks like a clipboard).
                        Then go to Terminal and type &quot;git clone&quot;.
                        After you did that, paste the url in the same line. Then
                        in the next line type git config user.email"Type email
                        here". Then in the next line type git config
                        user.name"Type name here". And then type &quot;git
                        status&quot;. Then type &quot;code .&quot;. This will
                        take you to Visual Studio Code (if it is installed or
                        you will have to install it). Then create a new file and
                        make the changes that you want to make.
                    </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class="git-p">
                        Now, press the button under the magnifying glass on the
                        left. That is where you have to commit all your changes.
                        After that, press the file you made changes on, and see
                        if they seem right. Then press the + next to the file
                        you made changes in. This will add the changes you made.
                        Then press the box and explain what you changed or
                        added. Then go to the Terminal and type &quot;git
                        push&quot;. Then type your user name and your password.
                        This will push the changes you made and make them
                        visible to everyone that can see your repositories. Then
                        repeat all the steps and then make more changes!
